# MLOps SMS Spam Classification Project

End-to-end MLOps pipeline for classifying SMS messages as Spam or Ham, using Python, MLflow, DVC, and modular preprocessing.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a full Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) workflow applied to SMS spam detection — including:

- Data processing & cleaning

- Modular ML pipeline

- Experiment tracking

- Versioned data management

- Reproducible training workflow

- Automated evaluation and artifact storage

The goal is to build a scalable, reproducible, production-ready pipeline rather than just a one-off ML model.
